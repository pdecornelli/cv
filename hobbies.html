	<h1>My hobbies</h1>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>üèÄ Basketball: </strong>Ever since I was a little boy, I've been into sports. My favorite sport growing up was f√∫tbol (soccer for those reading from the US) and I was pretty good at it. I performed 
			decently at every sport, but f√∫tbol was more of a passion. When I lived in the US my AYSO soccer team from Clearmont, California, "BLUE ICE", were divisional champions! But when I came back from the states, 
			I met my best friend who also lived in the United States and he loved basketball. The problem was that he was bad at every other sport so to do an activity together I decided to give basketball a try 
			and it was a life changing experience.  
		</li>
		<li><strong>üèç Motorcyles: </strong>This is a pretty recent passion, aldo it's been a family thing for ages. My grandfather traveled all along Argentina when he was my age, and my dad owned a motorcycle when he 
			was my age too. Actually my dad owned a bike till I was about ten, he had an agreement with my mother which said that he would be able to own a motorcycle until I reached the floor siting on the bike 
			(definitely my mom was pretty afraid of motorcycles). I say that motorcycles are a recent passion, because it started due to the Covid Pandemic. In Argentina the lock-down was pretty harsh, you couldn't 
			travel from city to city and I was obligated to stay at my hometown of Cosquin for about six months. Cosquin is a city in C√≥rdoba's "sierras" (small mountains) and it has a lot of places to go 
			hiking/trekking but are hard to access by car, so to visit all these places I decided to buy a motorcycle! Now that the pandemic has calmed down a bit, me and my wife are travelling all along Cordoba's 
			mountains discovering new places every weekend.

		<li><strong>Playing Drums: </strong>This hobby of mine goes way back! I started playing the drums when I was about 7/8 years old in church back when I lived in the US, and it's been in my life ever since. 
			My favorite drummers ar Dave Abbruzzese (former Pearl Jam drummer), Taylor Hawkins (from Foo Fighters), and of course the almighty Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Queen of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, etc.).

		<li><strong>üéÆ Gaming and PC building: </strong>Since I played Mario Bros and FIFA WC 98 for the first back when i was four years old, video gaming has been an important hobby in mi life. Aldo in the 
			mean time is kind of in a stand by due to two main reasons:
			<ol>
				<li>I've been mostly a console player and in the middle of the Covid Pandemic (right before I bought my motorcycle) I sold it to become a PC gamer, awful idea... Due to the pandemic, global 
					prices of PC components specially GPUs (graphics processors - most important part for gaming) skyrocketed. So i'm in the middle of a gaming drought.  
				</li>
				<li>
					Second reason is that I got married, so the time I spent gaming I now spend having quality time with my wife (talk about maturity...).  
				</li>
			</ol>
			Altough I'm not playing video games at this time, I'm aware of what goes on in the gaming community due to my nephews who are gamers and due to some YouTube channels I follow like Linus Tech Tips. 
		</li>
	</ul> 	
	<p>
		My list of hobbies goes on and on. I put a lot of effort on disconnecting myself from every day problems, specially those related to work! I'm gonna mention some of my other hobbies, that could be a 
		good conversation starting point if we ever meet! 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tech things in general: </strong>I like to be up to date with everything that goes around the tech industry</li>
			<li><strong>Religion: </strong>I'm christian and son of a theologian so I like to invest some of my time studying the bible and learning about God, Israel, etc.</li>
			<li><strong>Music: </strong>Music is a big deal in my life, I know a lot of things about music from Tango to Classic Rock (and everything in the middle).</li>
			<li><strong>Politics and Economics: </strong>As an Argentinian those two things are a big deal. I like to read a lot about these two subjects, I don't categorize myself as a book reader person 
			but if I read books they're normally of Politics and Global Economics. I have actually taken classes related to Financial Markets (Yale - Coursera) and international commerce because i feal 
			a big interest in these things. I believe that you have to learn and understand where you're standing, know where your coming from to predict were your heading, of course globally speaking.</li>
			<li><strong>Learning Enthusiast: </strong>I'm a person who loves to learn, I could be all day studying and it will not be a problem for me, my curriculum is an example of that. 
			I love learning about all kinds of subjects in general, I like to say that if I had all the money in the world and didn't have to work again, I'll probably be all day studying. I think 
			that's something that I inherited from my father he has like six degrees in subjects that don't even relate to each other (from theology to accountant) he even has a PhD, and even now being 
			retired if you go to his place you'll probably find him studying something new.</li>
